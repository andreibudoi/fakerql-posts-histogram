# fakerql-posts-histogram

React application that fetches a relevantly-sized list of posts from the mock GraphQL API available at [https://fakerql.stephix.uk/](https://fakerql.stephix.uk/) using Apollo and displays a histogram representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019.

## Challenges

The main challenge of this project was customizing Visx to fit my needs, due to the fact that it’s not as well documented as Apollo or GraphQL. Despite this being my first time using any of these three technologies, Apollo was fairly easy to pick up and GraphQL queries are incredibly fun to use. After fetching the data from the FakerQL API, I had to figure out how to format it, in order to pass it to the Visx histogram component and display it properly. I had to settle for a quick and plain bar graph, written in Javascript, unlike all the examples written in Typescript, provided by Visx.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
